Lab 0 for CS100, Fall 2019

This is a website about newly-famous rapper, Megan Thee Stallion.
On every page, I have a header with the artist's name as well as a navbar which shows all pages on the site.
On the home page (index.html), I have a picture of the artist as well as a table depicting the way her works have risen in the charts.
On the "Tina Snow" page (snow.html), I have this album's cover as well as the songs on it.
On the "Fever" page (fever.html), I also have the album's cover as well as the songs on it.
Finally, in my styles.css file, I style the table, some header/title text, the tracklists, and also some pictures.
